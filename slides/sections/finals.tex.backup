\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Research Questions}
	Some research questions:
	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item The greater the number of LoC, the greater the number of dependencies?
		\item How does program size influence feature dependencies?
% 		\item The greater the number of \#ifdefs, the greater the number of dependencies?
		\item How does cpp's variability mechanisms influence feature dependencies?
% 		\item Which the rate of growth in the number of dependencies regarding the number of features?
		\item How does number of features influence feature dependencies?
% 		\item The greater the number of dependencies, the greater the number of bugs introduced in LPS maintenance tasks?
		\item How does feature dependencies influence bugs introduced in LPS maintenance tasks?
		\item ...
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Next Steps}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Next Steps}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Add LoC metric to analysis and try to answer the first research question
		\item Analyze resulting data and try to answer the second and third research questions
		\item Define a sistematic way to perform a search in bug repositories (and try to answer the forth research question)
		\item Analyze outliers
		\item Try to understand behind the numbers
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Future Work}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Add LoFC (Lines of Feature Code) metric to analysis
% 		\item Answer other questions:
% 		\begin{itemize}
% 			\item How does project type/domain influence feature dependencies?
% % 			\item What kind of bugs are more commonly raised by features dependencies?
% 			\item There are relation between kind of bugs and features dependencies?
% 			\item ...
% 		\end{itemize}
		\item Integrate with Epona (concurrency tool)
		\item Think about other dependency types
	\end{itemize}
